# Smart Street Lighting System

## Problem Statement

  In urban and suburban environments, street lighting plays a crucial role in ensuring public safety, security, and overall well-being. However, the conventional systems of street lighting are often inefficient, leading to unnecessary energy consumption and increased operational costs. Moreover, manual control of streetlights may result in inconsistent illumination, compromising public safety during certain periods of the night.

## Principle:-

LDR is a light-dependent resistor that changes its resistance when different amounts of light fall on it. The working principle of an LDR is photoconductivity, which is an optical phenomenon. When the light falls on the LDR, then the electrons in the valence band of the material are jump to the conduction band thereby enhancing conductivity of the material.
